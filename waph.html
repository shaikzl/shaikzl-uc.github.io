    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This course is meant to be a complete web app development course where the students learn both front-end technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end development using PHP and MySQL. Students will gain practical experience in web application vulnerabilities and attacks, acquiring secure programming principles to help ensure these risks are minimized. The course also has a chapter on version control (git) and DevOps. The course objective includes: improve the skills of using modern techniques for web system analysis, design, and implementation; strengthen the programming skills for building robust software products; and acquire the security analysis skills to identify and prevent web vulnerabilities. By the end of the course, students will be able to go through the process of building and deploying secure web applications, understand the concepts of web application security, detect and prevent security threats, and apply their knowledge to the current technology.
