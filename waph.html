    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This course was intended to be an all-encompassing web app development course in where learners study both front-end technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS) and back-end programming with PHP and MySQL. Learners will receive hands-on experience with web application vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as safe programming concepts for preventing these risks. The course incorporates a chapter on version control (git) and DevOps. .The course objective includes: improve the skills of using modern techniques for web system analysis, design, and implementation; strengthen the programming skills for building robust software products; and acquire the security analysis skills to identify and prevent web vulnerabilities. By the end of the course, students will be able to go through the process of building and deploying secure web applications, understand the concepts of web application security, detect and prevent security threats, and apply their knowledge to the current technology.
