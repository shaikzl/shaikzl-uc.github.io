I employed the Bootstrap CSS framework for creating my website more flexible and accessible. I sped up the development of layouts and elements by utilizing Bootstrap's grid structure and already assembled UI components such as buttons, navbars, and cards. In order to reduce the need for bespoke CSS, I used Bootstrap's utility classes for dealing with typography, color improvements, spacing, and scaling. In addition, I chose a Bootswatch theme, which is free and open-source, and effortlessly linked it with a content delivery network (CDN) to access pre-defined CSS styles for enhancing the overall look of my site.
